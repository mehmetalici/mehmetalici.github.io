Hi:waving_hand:

My name is Mehmet and I am an experienced software engineer working in the field of Embedded Machine Learning. 

My professional line of work involves optimizing Deep Learning models for target hardware architectures, working with sensor data and to developing high- and low-level applications and libraries to map Deep Learning models on embedded hardware.

Aside from my industry profile, I enjoy working with Python and C/C++ languages and am interested in DevOps lifecycle topics. 

In this website, I would like to post my *human* experiences over the course of my career that I find interesting to share with you and also my hobby projects.

For any matter, feel free to contact me over my LinkedIn profile.

Until then, cheers!

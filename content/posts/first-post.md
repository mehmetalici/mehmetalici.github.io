## Introduction
- As reader good: Critical comments in code, visual design sketches, good READMEs. In fact, they are as writer more helpful.   
- Bird-eye view: What to achieve, how etc.
- Alternative: Third-party developer: Seeing things from other person's perspective. 
- What is a good software: How much time it takes for a newcomer to understand your code. This perspective is lost when coding. But writing is reasoning. Writing is cheaper than code. Finding good words for your stream of thought.   
- When writing you want to be correct. Substantiate your stream of thought -> Better code

## READMEs 
- Improve reproduciblity
- Summary section reminds me which problem it solves. Finding it helps you to draw boundaries. You develop what you promise. Avoid overengineering. 
- Gauge how easy it is for the newcomer
- How are the prerequisites
- Try readme out on a fresh env and see if it works


## Issues

## Conclusion
- Maybe go to first principles: Coding is only 20%. Designing is writing and management

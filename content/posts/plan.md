## Introduction
- As reader good: Critical comments in code, visual design sketches, good READMEs. In fact, creating them as writer more helpful.   

## Justification
- Bird-eye view: What to achieve, how etc.
- Alternative: Third-party developer: Seeing things from other person's perspective. 
- What is a good software: How much time it takes for a newcomer to understand your code. This perspective is lost when coding. But writing is reasoning. Writing is cheaper than code. Finding good words for your stream of thought.   
- When writing you want to be correct. Justify your stream of thought -> Better code

## Specific Example 1: READMEs 
- 3rd party view
- Improve reproduciblity
- Summary section reminds me which problem it solves.  
- Helps in gauge how easy it is for the newcomer
- How are the prerequisites
- Try readme out on a fresh env and see if it works


## Specific Example 2: Issues
- Obvious reason: Git integration
- Helps to reason on features
- Drawing boundaries of different features, Avoid overengineering and multiple features on one issue
- Think more on versioning 
- Issue comments: Use them as diary. P
- Branches are to be removed but issues remain. Evolution of the project and design decisions. Easy to communicate.
- Gamification: Just like tests, closing issues give dopamine. 

## Specific Example 3: AI Chatbots and Writing
- AI delivers bad code. Yes true to a certian extent.
- Good Prompt engineering is quite critical
- Good prompt engineering requires good writing.
- Good writing leads optimal usage of LLMs. 

## Conclusion
- Robots: Motion planning, Google Maps: Motion Planning, Good planning is prerequisite and writing leads to deep thinking, reasoning and therefore better software.
